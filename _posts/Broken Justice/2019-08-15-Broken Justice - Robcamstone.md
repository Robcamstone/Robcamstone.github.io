### Details
First of all the post above was blocked on the grounds the external lick was linking to content that doesn't meet Facebook's Community Standards which as you can see is a lie.

I contacted Facebook and then the whole website was and is blocked because it doesn't meet Facebook's Community Standards, I guest complaining to Facebook must be grounds for breaking their Community Standards.

### Tried, Judged and Condemned by Facebook

> Missing OnThisDay some sad individual(s) have reported the above post as abusive.
>
> I note how whoever you/they are have not left a request here pointing out the issues with the post and why it should be removed, must have some strange motive if you need to hide who you are.
>
> I am sick to death of the Lena Zavaroni Mafia who think that only they can run a fan page/group about her and go out of their way to close anybody else down.
>

>
> I'm so upset by this, all I have ever set out to do was to keep the memories we have of Lena Zavaroni around and try to paint a honest as possible picture of her life and death.

> This is why there is such a limited amount of content abut Lena Zavaroni available because of the group of people that what to own and control all things related to Lena Zavaroni even content they do not own. Well your not true fans and you're just trying to control fandom. Was not Lena Zavaroni controlled enough when she was alive without so-called fans trying to control her now she is dead you should be Fucking ashamed of yourselves!
