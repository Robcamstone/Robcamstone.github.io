## Tried, Judged and Condemned by Facebook

> Missing OnThisDay some sad individual(s) have reported this post as abusive.
>
> I note how whoever you/they are have not left a request here pointing out the issues with the post and why it should be removed, must have some strange motive if you need to hide who you are.
>
> I am sick to death of the Lena Zavaroni Mafia who think that only they can run a fan page/group about her and go out of their way to close anybody else down.
>
> I have seen many a good page and group taken down for no reason other than the Lena Zavaroni Mafia don't want it.
>
> Fellow fans unless you want to see another Lena Zavaroni fan page get closed down you need to make your views heard to Facebook.
>
> Below is a screenshot that the so-called abusive post linked to.
>
> My apologies to Lena Zavaroni for linking her name to the Mafia but can't think of any other why of classing those so-called fans who are out to own and control all content related to Lena Zavaroni.
>
> We are not competing, well I'm not...!
>
> I'm so upset by this all I have ever set out to do was to keep the memories we have of Lena Zavaroni around and try to paint an honest as possible picture of her life and death.
>
> This is why there is such a limited amount of content abut Lena Zavaroni available because of the group of people that what to own and control all things related to Lena Zavaroni even content they do not own. Well your not true fans and you're just trying to control fandom. Was not Lena Zavaroni controlled enough when she was alive without so-called fans trying to control her now she is dead you should be F**king ashamed of yourself?
>
> Let us take the content watermaker it and claim it as our own, that form of fandom suck and kills fandom, it does not extend it.
>
> Hopefully at sometime during today Facebook will re-instate the post I have contacted them and asked them to explain the taking of it down and what section is abusive and of cause to re-instate it.
