> Today 20 June 2019 I Went to pick up my prescription they took over &frac12; hour looking in various places and could not locate it, in the end, I told them I was going to go and do my weekly shop and would come back afterwards.
>
> I returned approx 45 mins later and they claimed it had been collected days before which it had not (They must have known they were lying or why did they spend so long looking for my medication as the database on their computer could have told them right away if it had been issued or not).
>
> I pointed out the fact that they had not issued it to me. They claimed that as it had been issued they could not issue a second amount, again I pointed out it had not been issued, I had to cut across them telling me what I had to do next.
>
> I pointed out I did not have to do anything as they were the ones at fault and so the duty of care was on them.
>
> So I then sat down and told them I would not be leaving the pharmacy until I had received my medication and that they were welcome to call the police and I would not be leaving even after closing time unless I got my medication which had not been issued and that it seems they could not claim it had be as they spent over an hour looking for it.
>
> I should point out I have Comorbid ICD-10 F84.5 Aspergerâ€™s syndrome and one of the many Comorbidities I have is ICD-10 F33.1 Recurrent Depressive Disorder for which some of the medications was for.
>
> Within 5 mins of me sitting down and rocking they were able to issue the medication.
>
> The fact they spent so much time looking for my medication proves they do not keep reliable records and I feel they lied about having issued them but if they have issued them, then they have issued them to the wrong person which is even worse than trying to cover up the fact they had not prepared my medication for me to collect and do not keep their computerise records up-to-date.
>
> This pharmacy needs investigating and if need be, be shut down as they have shown they are incompetent and try to place that incompetence on their customs and in my case responsible for adding to the stress I already feel when having to go out.
>
> They should be ashamed of the way they treat people.
