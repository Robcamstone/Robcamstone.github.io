> To day 20 June 2019  I Went to pick up my prescription they took over 1/2 hour looking in various places and could not locate it in the end I told them I was going to go and do my weekly shop and would come back afterwards.
>
> Returned approx 45 mins later and they claimed it had been collected days before which it had not, I pointed out the fact that they had not issued it to me. They claimed that as it had been issued they could not issue a second amount, again I pointed out it had not been issued, I had to cut across them telling me what I had to do next.
>
> I pointed out I did not have to do anything as they were the ones at fault and so the duty of care was on them.
>
> So I then sat down and told them I would not be leaving the pharmacy until I had received my medication and that they were well come to call the police and I would not be leaving even after closing time unless I got my medication.
>
> I should point out I have Comorbid ICD-10 F84.5 Aspergerâ€™s syndrome and one of the many Comorbidities I have is ICD-10 F33.1 Recurrent Depressive Disorder for which some of the medications were for.
>
> Withing 5 mins of me sitting down and rocking they were able to issue the medication.
>
> This pharmacy needs investigating and if need be, be shut down as they have show they are incompetent and try to place that incompetence on their customs and the are in my case responsible for add the stress I already feel when having to go out.
>
> They should be ashamed of the way they treat people.
