# Robert Browning (7 May 1812 â€“ 12 December 1889)

## On Deck

> There is nothing to remember in me, Nothing I ever said with a grace, Nothing I did that you care to see, Nothing I was that deserves a place in your mind, now I leave you, set you free.
>
> How strange it were if you had all of me, as I have all you in my heart and brain, You, whose least word brought gloom or glee Who never lifted the hand in vain - Will hold mine yet, from over the sea! 
Strange, if a face, when you thought of me, rose like your own face present now, with eyes as dear in their due degree,
>
> Much such a mouth, and as bright a brow, Till you saw yourself, while you cried "Tis She!"
>
> Well, you may, you must, set down to me Love that was life, life that was love; A tenure of breath as your lips' decree, A passion to stand as your thoughts approve, A rapture to fall where your foot might be.
>
> But did one touch of such love for me Come in a word or a look of yours, Whose words and looks will, circling, flee Round me and round while life endures,- Could I fancy 'As I feel, thus feels he'.
